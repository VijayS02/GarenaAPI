# GarenaAPI

Allows python acces to league of legends garena data. This uses simple requests to retrieve data from the LOL garena network.

# Motivation
While the League of legends community has a large following, it also has a large script and data analysis side to it. This API allows users using the Garena version of the game
to view stats and create their own websites/software on top of. While it is simply a starting point, I hope it inspires more to create working English/Multi-lingual versions of op.gg. 

## Note that robots.txt and scraping details have not been fully checked.
Please consider the website's rate limits and do not overload the servers with requests.


# Example
Please see Example.py to see how to create a simple user query and view their match history.
